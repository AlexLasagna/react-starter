# ~ React boilerplate ~

# [Webpack 4, babel 7, styled-components, linter]

Fast builder for your SPA projects.

There are 2 versions of a project:

1) [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) `git clone https://github.com/AlexLasagna/react-starter.git`
2) [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) `git clone -b sass-branch https://github.com/AlexLasagna/react-starter.git`

If you familiar with styled it's better to use it instead of Sass branch.
